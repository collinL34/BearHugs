    <p class='purple-text'>Hello, my name is Bear, and I am the luckiest dog in the world. I live in Pleasanton with my amazing family. It's a big family, but I love it. I have three sisters, Haley, Hannah and my favorite Heather, along with my three brothers, Logan, Jacob and Nathan.</p>
    <p class='purple-text'>And of course my lovely parents. I love them sooooo much they give me lots of chicken to eat.</p>
